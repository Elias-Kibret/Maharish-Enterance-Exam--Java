/* A number can be encoded as an integer array as follows. The first element of the array is any number and
if it is negative then the encoded number is negative. Each digit of the number is the absolute value of the
difference of two adjacent elements of the array. The most significant digit of the number is the absolute
value of the difference of the first two elements of the array. For example, the array {2, -3, -2, 6, 9, 18}
encodes the number 51839 because

• 5 is abs(2 - (-3))
• 1 is abs(-3 - (-2))
• 8 is abs(-2 - 6)
• 3 is abs(6-9)
• 9 is abs(9-18)


The number is positive because the first element of the array is >= 0.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function prototype is
int decodeArray(int[ ] a)
If you are programming in C or C++, the function prototype is
int decodeArray(int a[ ], int len) where len is the length of array a;
You may assume that the encoded array is correct, i.e., the absolute value of the difference of any two
adjacent elements is between 0 and 9 inclusive and the array has at least two elements.




Examples
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
a is                       then function returns                        reason

{0, -3, 0, -4, 0}              3344                                because abs(0-(-3)=3, abs(-3-0)=3, abs(0-(-4))=4, abs(-4-0)=4
{-1, 5, 8, 17, 15}            -6392                                because abs(-1-5)=6, abs(5-8)=3, abs(8-17)=9, abs(17-15)=2; the number is negative because the first element of the array is negative
{1, 5, 8, 17, 15}            4392                                  because abs(1-5)=4, remaining digits are the same as previous
