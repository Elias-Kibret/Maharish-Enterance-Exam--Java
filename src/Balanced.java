/* QUESTION 1. An array is called balanced if its even numbered elements (a[0], a[2], etc.) are even and its odd
numbered elements (a[1], a[3], etc.) are odd. Write a function named isBalanced that accepts an array of
integers and returns 1 if the array is balanced, otherwise it returns 0. Examples: {2, 3, 6, 7} is balanced since

a[0] and a[2] are even, a[1] and a[3] are odd. {6, 7, 2, 3, 12} is balanced since a[0], a[2] and a[4] are even, a[1]
and a[3] are odd. {7, 15, 2, 3} is not balanced since a[0] is odd. {16, 6, 2, 3} is not balanced since a[1] is even.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is
int isBalanced(int[ ] a)
If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is
int isBalanced(int a[ ], int len)
where len is the number of elements in the array.
